# Hi, I'm Javier Bejarano Jimenez 👋

I am a **Software Engineering** student at **Allegheny College** with a passion for understanding how software interacts with hardware. My work ranges from high-level Python automation to bare-metal Assembly programming.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python, C, 6502 Assembly, VBA
* **Systems:** Memory Management (Stack/Heap), Computer Organization, Low-Level Logic
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions, VS Code, Pico SDK

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Memory-Structures-in-C](https://github.com/javito350/Memory-Structures-in-C)
* Implemented a **Circular Linked List** on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
* Managed dynamic memory allocation (Heap) and pointer "re-knitting" for node removal.
* Developed rigorous logic to handle edge cases like head-node deletion and infinite loops.

### [6502-Assembly-project](https://github.com/javito350/6502-Assembly-project)
* **Bare-metal programming** for the MOS 6502 processor.
* Developed a Fibonacci sequence generator using low-level registers (A, X, Y) and memory mapping.
* Explored hardware-level signals and instruction sets for system optimization.

### [File-Sorting-Algorithm-Benchmarker](https://github.com/javito350/File-Sorting-Algorithm-Benchmarker)
* A **Python** utility that analyzes the efficiency (Big-O) of different sorting algorithms.
* Built to visualize performance data and optimize data processing workflows.

## 📈 Current Focus
I am currently diving deeper into **Systems Programming** and exploring how to optimize backend algorithms for resource-constrained environments.
