# Reflective Report

> In your own words, describe the difference between an `array` and a `linked list`.

`TODO`

> Describe the relationship between `linked list`s and the `heap`.

`TODO`

> In order to access memory on the `stack` or `heap`, we need to user `pointer`s. 
> What is a pointer? How is it useful? Why do you think we need to use them at all?

`TODO`

> `C` features a command that allows us to allocate memory in the heap (`malloc`). Speculate: why
> would we need a command to do that? What implication(s) does this have for memory usage?

> Hint: consider the idea of a `stack` growing infinitely on our device. If the heap can grow infinitely
> large, what might this mean?
